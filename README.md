## 🔍 Named Entity Recognition Using Transformer Models

In this project, we’re tackling **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using the powerful **Transformer architecture**. The goal is to build a model that can accurately identify entities like persons, places, and organizations from a given input text. Ready to dive into transformer models for NLP? Let’s get started! 💡🤖

## Project Overview

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is a key task in natural language processing that involves identifying specific entities within text, such as names of people, places, or organizations. In this project, we’ll leverage the **Transformer architecture** to solve this problem.

We’ll start by preprocessing the input text data to make it suitable for training. Using **PyTorch** and the **Hugging Face Transformers library**, we’ll develop a small transformer model and train it on a token classification task for NER. After that, we’ll fine-tune a state-of-the-art transformer model from Hugging Face to further improve accuracy.

### Key Features:

- 🔍 **Named Entity Recognition**: Train a transformer model to identify entities in text, such as people, places, and organizations.
- 🧠 **Transformer Architecture**: Build and fine-tune transformer models to solve the NER problem.
- 🔧 **Preprocessing for NER**: Preprocess text data to get it ready for transformer-based training.
- 🎯 **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune a pretrained transformer model for better performance on NER tasks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for the project.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building and training transformer models.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For accessing pretrained models and fine-tuning them.
- **NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib**: For data manipulation and visualization.
